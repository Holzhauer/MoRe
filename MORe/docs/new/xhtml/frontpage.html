	A main purpose is to enhance modeling evolving and dynamic networks, which explains the name.</p>

		<li>Network generators
			<ul>

			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Support for advanced edge objects</li>
		<li>Calculation and management of network an node measures</li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Origin</h2>
	<p class="text">Some of the features and code is based on ReSoNetA, but more directed to Repast Simphony (RS).
	Like the network facilities in RS and ReSoNetA it is based on the JUNG library. However, it is also intended to be
	used with other network implementations by building wrappers.</p>
